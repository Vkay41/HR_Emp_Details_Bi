In this Power BI project, we developed a comprehensive dashboard to analyze employee data, encompassing key details such as race, gender, salary, termination status, and other essential employee information. By leveraging Power BI's powerful data visualization capabilities, we created interactive charts and graphs that provide insights into workforce demographics, salary distribution, and termination trends. This dashboard not only helps HR departments to monitor and manage employee metrics but also supports data-driven decision-making to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. It serves as a valuable tool for enhancing transparency and optimizing HR processes within the organization.
